          "Correct! Preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders when it comes to receiving dividends. This means that if a company decides to pay dividends, preferred stockholders must be paid before common stockholders receive anything. This priority makes preferred stock more attractive to income-focused investors who want more certainty in their dividend payments.",
